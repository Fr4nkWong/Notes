- *Vec2Face: Unveil Human Faces From Their Blackbox Features in Face Recognition*	CVPR2020
  - 

```
- 
- This paper presents a generative structure with bijective metric learning, DiBiGAN, for synthesizing faces of an identity given that person’s features.
- A distillation process is introduced to maximize the information exploited from the blackbox face recognition engine.
- A Feature-Conditional Generator Structure with Exponential Weighting Strategy is presented for a more robust generator that can synthesize realistic faces with ID preservation.

```
- This paper proposed a a novel frame level Face Anti-Spoofing(FAS) method based on Central Difference Convolution Network(CDCN), which is able to capture intrinsic detailed patterns via aggregating both intensity and gradient information.
- CDCN is able to provide more robust modeling capacity than its counterpart built with vanilla convolution.
